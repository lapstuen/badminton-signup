## v2025-11-07 17:00 - Line Notifications

### New Features

#### 1. Share Session to Line 📤

- Shares published session details to Line group
- Shows available spots, waiting list, payment amount
- Includes direct signup link
- Location: Admin Panel → after "Publish Session" button

**Usage:**

4. Line group receives announcement

**Message Format:**
```
🏸 BADMINTON SESSION PUBLISHED!
📅 Day and date
🕐 Time
💰 Payment amount
👥 Current players and available spots
👉 Signup link
```

#### 2. Smart Cancellation Notifications 🎯

**Re-enabled automatic Line notifications when users cancel registration**

**Smart Logic:**
- **No waiting list** → Send "SLOT AVAILABLE!" with signup link
- **With waiting list** → Send simple cancellation notice (no signup link)

**Why smart?**
- If there's a waiting list, the spot is automatically filled
- No need to spam group with signup links when spot isn't actually available
- Reduces notification noise

**Message Examples:**

*No waiting list (10/12 players):*
```
🏸 SLOT AVAILABLE! / มีที่ว่าง!
⚠️ John cancelled registration
👥 Now 9/12 players
👉 Sign up here: [link]
Reply quickly!
```

*With waiting list (14/12 players):*
```
⚠️ Jane cancelled registration
👥 Now 13/12 players
📅 Session details
```
